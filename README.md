light-box, masonry, responsive, easy upload add, delete, reorder - no DB, filter by categories, multiple categories, new categories....delete catagories


CURRENT CONDITION>>>
W.I.P. (work in progress)
the whole repo should be dumped into a "gallery" folder in the root DIR (this is temporary)
the gallery/admin pages are bieng built out. upload works, mulit upload is awesome.

to use the gallery, try the index.html example, just add the script and name the kitchen to put the 
gallery into the div you need it in.

it currently works by rewriting the javascript file every time a file is uploaded.
no dependancies. no jquery needed (so far...want to keep it that way)
